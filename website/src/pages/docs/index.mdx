import { PackageCmd } from '@theguild/components'

# Getting Started

An open source library you install on your GraphQL server to create a fully RESTful and configurable API gateway.

- **Don’t choose between REST and GraphQL**
- Get most of the **benefits of GraphQL** on the backend and frontend, while using and **exposing REST**
- **Support all your existing clients** with REST while improving your backend stack with GraphQL
- Create custom, perfectly client-aligned REST endpoints for your frontend simply by naming a route and attaching a query
- In the other way around (REST to GraphQL) you won’t get the best of both worlds. Instead just less powerful, harder-to-maintain server implementations with a some of the benefits of GraphQL. It can be a good and fast start for a migration though.
- Fully **generated documentation** that is always up-to-date
- **GraphQL Subscriptions as Webhooks**
