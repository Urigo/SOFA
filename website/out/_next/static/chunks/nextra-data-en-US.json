Those messages would have to have their own endpoint. We call this type of data, a Model. In REST you probably call them Resources.In order to treat particular types as Models you need to provide two queries, one that exposes a list (with no non-optional arguments) and the other to fetch a single entity (id field as an argument). The model itself has to have an id field. Those are the only requirements.\n# Message is treated as a Model\ntype Query {\n  messages: [Message]\n  message(id: ID): Message\n}\ntype Message {\n  id: ID\n  # other fields ...\n}"}},"/docs/essentials/queries":{"title":"Queries","data":{"":"Queries are transformed into GET requests.Given the following example:\ntype Comment {\n  id: ID\n  text: String\n}\ntype Query {\n  comments: [Comment]\n}\nSofa will create a GET /comments route.\ncurl http://localhost:3000/api/comments"}},"/docs/essentials/mutations":{"title":"Mutations","data":{"":"Mutations are transformed into POST requests.Given the following example:\ntype Comment {\n  id: ID\n  text: String\n}\ntype Mutation {\n  addComment(text: String!)
